# Order

Forms are ordered by the date added.

The latest form always transforms back into Grip.

# Adding a Form

Follow the template for `bright.json` on how to add your own form.

Make sure to "self-copy" the latest added form (like `bright.json` does with the charge form) and link its `use_action` transformation to the one(s) you're adding.
